SSDP TESTING TOOLS
------------------

0. Summary
This package was built with the goal to simplify the testing of SSDP. There
are several components to this utility: generate.py, listen.py, and send.py.

1. Generating SSDP packets
generate.py is used to generate the packets required for SSDP. When run, a
MSEARCH packet and a NOTIFY packet are generated and written to the packet
folder. The NOTIFY packet is built using this system's real OS and OS version,
so there's no "lying" to the network involved. Every time generate.py is run,
a new advertisement UUID is generated.

2. Listening in on the network
listen.py listens in on the multicast network and collects any packets that it
detects. Detected packets are immediately printed to standard output. The first
argument is the amount of seconds that the program should listen in on the
multicast address. The second argument is the output file. If a target file
for output was provided, all collected messages will be written to the file.

3. Writing onto the network
send.py sends packets over the multicast network. There are three ways to use
send.py: sending notify packets, sending msearch packets, and sending custom
packets that can be built on the fly.
